Run MainGUI to input probabilty, games in a series and games needed to win
Mets vs. Yankees!

The World Series is a series of up-to 7 games (“best of 7”).  There are no tie games, and the first team to win 4 games wins the series (and there are no more games).  This means that the series may end after 4 games, or need all 7 to find the World Champion Team!!

Your assignment is to find the probability that the Mets will win the World Series against the Yankees. (We can do it if the team stays healthy!)

We will assume that the teams will have statistics similar to the past, with the Mets winning 46.3% of the games, and the Yankees winning 53.7% of the games
